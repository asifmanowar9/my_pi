# Assessment System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The assessment system provides a comprehensive way to track all types of assessments (quizzes, labs, midterm, presentation, final exam, and assignments) for each course. Each assessment has its own due date, reminder notification, and grade input. The system automatically calculates the overall GPA based on all graded assessments.

## Features

### 1. Assessment Types
Six types of assessments are supported:
- üìù **Quiz** (10% weight) - Can have multiple quizzes
- üß™ **Lab Report** (10% weight) - Can have multiple lab reports  
- üìö **Midterm Exam** (25% weight) - Single midterm
- üé§ **Presentation** (5% weight) - Single presentation
- üìñ **Final Exam** (35% weight) - Single final exam
- üìÑ **Assignment** (15% weight) - Can have multiple assignments

### 2. Individual Assessment Features
Each assessment includes:
- **Title and Description** - Custom name and details
- **Due Date & Time** - Specific deadline
- **Reminder Notification** - Scheduled alerts (15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 1 day, 2 days before)
- **Marks Entry** - Obtained marks and maximum marks
- **Completion Status** - Track whether completed
- **Percentage Calculation** - Automatic percentage from marks

### 3. Automatic GPA Calculation
The system automatically calculates:
- **Type Averages** - Average percentage for each assessment type (e.g., average of all quizzes)
- **Weighted GPA** - Uses predefined weights for each assessment type
- **Letter Grade** - Converts percentage to letter grade (A+, A, A-, etc.)
- **Overall Percentage** - Combined score across all assessment types
- **Status** - Performance status (Excellent, Very Good, Good, etc.)

### 4. Notification System
- Automatic reminders scheduled for each assessment
- Customizable reminder time (15 minutes to 2 days before)
- Uses exact alarm scheduling for precise timing
- Integrated with Android notification system

## Database Schema

  due_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  reminder_minutes INTEGER,
  marks REAL,
  max_marks REAL,

## Grade Calculation Formula

### Individual Assessment Percentage
```
Percentage = (Marks Obtained / Maximum Marks) √ó 100
```

### Type Average
```
Type Average = Sum of all percentages for type / Number of graded assessments of type
```

### Weighted GPA
```
Weighted GPA = (
  (Quiz Avg √ó 10%) +
  (Lab Avg √ó 10%) +
  (Midterm √ó 25%) +
  (Presentation √ó 5%) +
  (Final Exam √ó 35%) +
  (Assignment Avg √ó 15%)
) / Total Weight of Graded Types
```

### GPA Scale (4.0 scale)
- 90-100%: 4.0 (A+)
- 85-89%: 3.7 (A)
- 80-84%: 3.3 (A-)
- 77-79%: 3.0 (B+)
- 73-76%: 2.7 (B)
- 70-72%: 2.3 (B-)
- 67-69%: 2.0 (C+)
- 63-66%: 1.7 (C)
- 60-62%: 1.3 (C-)
- 57-59%: 1.0 (D+)
- 53-56%: 0.7 (D)
- 50-52%: 0.5 (D-)
- Below 50%: 0.0 (F)
