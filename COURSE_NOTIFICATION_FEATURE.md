  - `reminderMinutes` (int): Minutes before class to notify
  - Helper methods: `scheduleDaysText`, `classTimeText`, `reminderText`, `hasSchedule`

### Database
- **`database_helper_clean.dart`**:

  - Notification integration: `_scheduleNotificationsForCourse()`, `_cancelNotificationsForCourse()`
  - Updated: `createCourse()`, `updateCourse()`, `deleteCourse()`
  - Updated: `_buildCourseFromForm()`, `selectCourseForEditing()`, `clearForm()`

- **`course_assignment_controller.dart`**: Fixed
  - Removed alias import, directly using `DatabaseHelper`

### Services
- **`notification_service.dart`**: Added
  - `scheduleCourseReminders()`: Schedule recurring weekly notifications
  - `cancelCourseReminders()`: Cancel all notifications for a course

## Database Schema

### Courses Table (New Columns)
```sql
schedule_days TEXT,        -- Comma-separated weekday numbers (1-7)
class_time TEXT,           -- Format: "HH:mm" (24-hour)
reminder_minutes INTEGER   -- 10 or 15
```

## Notification Format

### Notification Title
```
üìö Class Starting Soon
```

### Notification Body
```
{Course Name} at {Time in 12h format} in {Classroom}
```

### Example
```
Title: üìö Class Starting Soon
Body: Introduction to Computer Science at 10:30 AM in Room 101
```

## How It Works

### 1. Creating a Course with Notifications
1. User fills in course details
2. User selects class days (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri)
3. User sets class time (e.g., 10:30 AM)
4. User chooses reminder (10 or 15 minutes)
5. On save, notifications are scheduled for all selected days

### 2. Notification Scheduling Logic
- For each selected day, calculate next occurrence
- Subtract reminder minutes from class time
- Schedule recurring weekly notification
- Use `DateTimeComponents.dayOfWeekAndTime` for weekly recurrence

### 3. Updating a Course
- Old notifications are cancelled
- New notifications are scheduled with updated information
- User sees success message

### 4. Deleting a Course
- All notifications for the course are cancelled
- Database records are removed
- User sees confirmation

## Technical Details

### Weekday Numbering
- 1 = Monday
- 2 = Tuesday
- 3 = Wednesday
- 4 = Thursday
- 5 = Friday
- 6 = Saturday
- 7 = Sunday

### Time Format
- **Stored**: 24-hour format "HH:mm" (e.g., "14:30")
- **Displayed**: 12-hour format with AM/PM (e.g., "2:30 PM")

### Notification IDs
- Generated using: `(courseId.hashCode + dayOfWeek * 1000).abs() % 2147483647`
- Ensures unique ID for each course-day combination
- Allows selective cancellation by course

### Android Channel Configuration
```dart
AndroidNotificationChannel(
  'course_reminder_notifications',
  'Class Reminders',
  description: 'Notifications reminding you of upcoming classes',
  importance: Importance.high,
  priority: Priority.high,
)
```

## Dependencies

All required packages were already installed:
- `flutter_local_notifications: ^17.2.2`
- `timezone: ^0.9.4`
- `uuid: ^4.5.1`

## Notes

- Notifications require app to have notification permissions
- iOS requires additional Info.plist configuration
- Android 13+ requires explicit notification permission request
- Notifications persist across app restarts
- Uses `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle` for precise timing

## Console Output Examples
