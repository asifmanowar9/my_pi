# Notification Not Working - Fix Applied

## Problem Identified

When creating a course with a class scheduled for **today**, the notification was being scheduled for **next week** instead of today.

### Root Cause

In the `_getNextWeekday` method in `notification_service.dart`, when the selected day matched the current day (`daysUntilNext == 0`), the code automatically added 7 days:

```dart
if (daysUntilNext == 0) {
  return date.add(const Duration(days: 7)); // ‚ùå WRONG! Skips today
}
```

This meant if you created a course on Friday for Friday at 2:20 PM, it would schedule for **next Friday** instead of **today**.

## Fix Applied

Changed the logic to return today's date when it's the same day:

```dart
if (daysUntilNext == 0) {
  return date; // ‚úÖ CORRECT! Returns today
}
```

The existing check `if (reminderTime.isAfter(now))` will determine if it's still schedulable.

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Class Today, Before Reminder Time
- **Current time**: 2:00 PM (14:00)
- **Class time**: 2:20 PM (14:20)
- **Reminder**: 10 minutes before
- **Reminder time**: 2:10 PM (14:10)
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **Schedules for TODAY at 2:10 PM**

### Scenario 2: Class Today, After Reminder Time
- **Current time**: 2:15 PM (14:15)
- **Class time**: 2:20 PM (14:20)
- **Reminder**: 10 minutes before
- **Reminder time**: 2:10 PM (14:10) [Already passed!]
- **Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Skips today, schedules for next week**

### Scenario 3: Class Tomorrow
- **Current time**: Friday 2:00 PM
- **Class time**: Saturday 2:20 PM
- **Reminder**: 10 minutes before
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **Schedules for tomorrow (Saturday) at 2:10 PM**

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Debug Logging
Added detailed console logs to see what's happening:

```
üìÖ Course: Introduction to CS | Day: 5
   ‚è∞ Class time: 2025-10-03 14:20:00.000
   üîî Reminder time: 2025-10-03 14:10:00.000
   üïê Current time: 2025-10-03 14:05:00.000
   ‚úì Is in future: true
‚úÖ Scheduled reminder for Introduction to CS on Friday at 2:20 PM (Reminder: 10 min before)
```

### 2. Notification Debug Page
Created a debug utility page at `lib/shared/widgets/notification_debug_page.dart` with:
- Test notification now
- Schedule test in 30 seconds
- View all pending notifications
- Cancel all notifications

## How to Test

### Test 1: Immediate Notification (To verify permissions work)
1. Open the app
2. Create any course
3. You should see console logs showing scheduling
4. Wait for the scheduled time

### Test 2: Using Debug Page
1. Add this route to your app:
```dart
Get.to(() => const NotificationDebugPage());
```

2. Tap "Send Test Notification Now"
   - Should see notification immediately
   - If not, check permissions

3. Tap "Schedule Test in 30 Seconds"
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Should receive notification
   - If not, check battery optimization

### Test 3: Course Notification (Real scenario)
1. **Delete the old course** (it was scheduled for next week)
2. **Create new course**:
   - Set class time to **5-10 minutes from now**
   - Select **today's weekday**
   - Set reminder to **10 minutes before**
3. **Check console** for logs showing:
   ```
   ‚úì Is in future: true
   ‚úÖ Scheduled reminder for...
   ```
4. **Wait for notification**

## Troubleshooting

### Still Not Receiving Notifications?

#### 1. Check Android Battery Optimization
- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Apps** ‚Üí **My Pi**
- Tap **Battery** ‚Üí **Unrestricted**

#### 2. Check Do Not Disturb
- Make sure DND is off or app is allowed

#### 3. Check Notification Permissions
```dart
// The app already requests permissions in notification_service.dart
// But you can verify in: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí My Pi ‚Üí Notifications
```

#### 4. Check Console Logs
Look for:
- ‚úÖ Scheduled reminder for... ‚Üê Good!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped: Reminder time has already passed ‚Üê Too late
- Invalid time values ‚Üê Check time format

#### 5. Check Pending Notifications
Add this temporary code to see what's scheduled:

```dart
final notificationService = Get.find<NotificationService>();
final pending = await notificationService.getPendingNotifications();
print('üìã Pending notifications: ${pending.length}');
for (final n in pending) {
  print('  - ID: ${n.id}, Title: ${n.title}');
}
```

## Why Your Test Didn't Work

When you created the course at 2:20 PM:
- If current time was **before 2:10 PM**: Should have worked (but didn't due to the bug)
- If current time was **after 2:10 PM**: Correctly skipped (reminder time already passed)

With the fix:
- If you create it **before 2:10 PM**: Will schedule for **today at 2:10 PM** ‚úÖ
- If you create it **after 2:10 PM**: Will schedule for **next week** (correct behavior)

## Next Steps

1. **Hot Restart** the app (not just hot reload):
   - Press 'R' in terminal
   - Or click the restart button in your IDE

2. **Delete existing courses** with wrong schedules

3. **Create new course** with proper timing:
   - Set class time at least 15 minutes from now
   - Set reminder to 10 minutes before
   - Select today's weekday

4. **Monitor console** for the debug logs

5. **Wait for notification**!

## Code Changes Summary

### File: `notification_service.dart`
- ‚úÖ Fixed `_getNextWeekday` to return today when applicable
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug logging
- ‚úÖ Added warning message when skipping past reminders

### File: `notification_debug_page.dart` (NEW)
