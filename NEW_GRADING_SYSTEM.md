# New Grading System Documentation

## Overview
The application now uses a comprehensive grading system with automatic GPA calculation based on weighted assessment types.

## Assessment Types and Weights

### 1. Quiz (15% / 15 marks)
- **Total Weight:** 15%
- **Max Marks:** 15 per quiz
- **Number Allowed:** 1-4 quizzes
- **Calculation Logic:**
  - System takes the **best 2 scores** from all quizzes
  - Calculates the **average marks** from these best 2
  - Example:
    ```
    Quiz 1: 12/15 (80%)
    Quiz 2: 14/15 (93.3%)
    Quiz 3: 10/15 (66.7%)
    Quiz 4: 13/15 (86.7%)
    
    Best 2: Quiz 2 (14) and Quiz 4 (13)
    Average: (14 + 13) / 2 = 13.5 marks
    Final Quiz Score: 13.5/15
    ```

### 2. Midterm Exam (20% / 20 marks)
- **Total Weight:** 20%
- **Max Marks:** 20
- **Number Allowed:** 1
- **Calculation Logic:**
  - Direct marks used
  - Example: 17/20 = 17 marks

### 3. Assignment/Presentation (20% / 20 marks total)
- **Total Weight:** 20% (shared)
- **Max Marks:** Depends on what exists
- **Auto-Split Logic:**
  
  **Case 1: Only Assignment exists**
  - Assignment gets full 20 marks
  - Example: 18/20 = 18 marks

  **Case 2: Only Presentation exists**
  - Presentation gets full 20 marks
  - Example: 16/20 = 16 marks

  **Case 3: Both Assignment AND Presentation exist**
  - Each gets 10 marks max (auto-split)
  - System scales them proportionally
  - Example:
    ```
    Assignment: 18/20 ‚Üí scaled to (18/20) √ó 10 = 9 marks
    Presentation: 16/20 ‚Üí scaled to (16/20) √ó 10 = 8 marks
    Total: 9 + 8 = 17 marks out of 20
    ```

### 4. Final Exam (40% / 40 marks)
- **Total Weight:** 40%
- **Max Marks:** 40
- **Number Allowed:** 1
- **Calculation Logic:**
  - Direct marks used
  - Example: 35/40 = 35 marks

### 5. Attendance (5% / 5 marks)
- **Total Weight:** 5%
- **Max Marks:** 5
- **Number Allowed:** 1
- **Calculation Logic:**
  - Direct marks input (e.g., 4.5/5)
  - Example: 4.5/5 = 4.5 marks

## Final Grade Calculation

### Total Marks Calculation
```
Total = Quiz + Midterm + Assignment/Presentation + Final + Attendance
Max Total = 15 + 20 + 20 + 40 + 5 = 100 marks
```

### Example Full Calculation
```
Quiz: 13.5/15 (best 2 average)
Midterm: 17/20
Assignment: 18/20 (or 9/10 if presentation exists)
Presentation: 8/10 (only if both exist)
Final: 35/40
Attendance: 4.5/5

Total: 13.5 + 17 + 17 + 35 + 4.5 = 87 marks out of 100
Percentage: 87%
```
